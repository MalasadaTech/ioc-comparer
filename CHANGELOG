2025 APR 04:
- Updated the filename from `domains.json` to a unique name to avoid conflicts.
- Modified the output write folder to ensure it uses a unique path for better organization.

2025 APR 05:
- Format the nameservers to lowercase, and in alphabetical order for correct matching.
- Add a feature to save the comparison analysis to a unique analysis.txt file.

2025 APR 10:
- Created the .gitignore and added the output folder.
- Replaced the deprecated datetime.datetime.utcnow() method.
- Changed the output to read the analysis text file output so that it's cleaner.
- Enabled defanged IOCs as inputs.
- Mapped to DTF (https://github.com/MalasadaTech/defenders-threatmesh-framework)
- Modified code to add any "none" or "Unknown" matches to a Low-value similarities array.
- Added feature to match on name server domain (P0101.011: Registration: Name Server Domain (https://github.com/MalasadaTech/defenders-threatmesh-framework/blob/main/pivots/P0101.011.md))

2025 APR 13:
- Fixed error when comparing SSL when one SSL cert array is empty.
- Added code to catch HTTP errors when fetching data.
- Added feature to perform a reverse lookup on IPs.
- Fixed problem when two domains match on the Registrar ID, but the registrar has a /d/b/a on one entry so it counted as a difference. It's now a match with a callout.
- Fixed problem with opening double quotes in the SSL Issuer Org output.
- Added feature to analyze single IOCs. Previously, it just stored it in a JSON if only one IOC was checked. Now it does the lookups and stores it in an analysis file to review later.

2025 APR 14:
- Added substring check with --sstring "substring". Could be useful for bulk checks. May need to circle back to this one and add an auto-check for substrings for string matches of three or more or something.

2025 APR 15:
- Added a feature to calculate the nshash for each single domain analysis, and also for the pairwise analysis. This will be beneficial for when you need to pivot in Silent Push.
- Modified the IP Address output section for the single domain analysis so that the address, hostname, and ASN are all on separate lines for better readability.

2025 APR 17:
- Added AlienVault OTX integration for threat intelligence enrichment.
